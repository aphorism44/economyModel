This REST API controls a model economy based on this paper:

https://larc.unt.edu/techreports/LARC-2010-03.pdf

The initial setup for the agents is configurable in the following file:

/src/main/resources/productionData.csv

One instance of the "market" is instantiated within Spring Boot.

Adds an agent of the type named by the string. There are currently five different agents types defined:

1. "farmer" (produces food)
2. "lumberjack" (produces wood)
3. "miner" (produces ore)
4. "refiner" (changes ore to metal)
5. "blacksmith" (changes metal to tools)

All of the agents consume food on a daily basis (with the exception of the farmer, which consumes wood).

All of the agents must have 1 tool in inventory to produce at top capacity (with the exception of the blacksmith, which produces tools).


The REST API has 3 endpoints:

"/status"

Outputs the status of the market at this particular iteration/turn. Currently the turn number, number of agents, and average prices.

"/add?agentType=s"

Adds 1 agent of the type specified by the string s (one of the 5 above choices, or it will return an error message).

"/iterate?turns=n"

Iterates the market by n "turns."
