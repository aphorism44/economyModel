This REST API controls a model economy based on this paper:

https://larc.unt.edu/techreports/LARC-2010-03.pdf

The initial setup for the agents is configurable in the following file:

/src/main/resources/productionData.csv

One instance of the "Market" Bean is instantiated within Spring Boot.

There are currently five different agents types defined:

1. "farmer" (produces food)
2. "lumberjack" (produces wood)
3. "miner" (produces ore)
4. "refiner" (changes ore to metal)
5. "blacksmith" (changes metal to tools)

All of the agents consume food on a daily basis (with the exception of the farmer, which consumes wood).

All of the agents must have 1 tool in inventory to produce at top capacity (with the exception of the blacksmith, which produces tools).


The REST API has 4 endpoints:

"/status"

Outputs the status of the market at this particular iteration/turn. Currently the turn number, number of agents, and breakdown of agents by type.

EXAMPLE OUTPUT:

{ turnNumber: 151,
totalAgents: 4,
farmer: 1,
lumberjack: 1,
miner: 1,
blacksmith: 1 }



"/prices?commodity=string"

Output the names and market value of the parameter commodity; if send without any commodity, it will output for all commodities.

EXAMPLE OUTPUTS:

{ food: 20,
wood: 13,
ore: 13,
metal: 37,
tools: 41 }

{ food: "35" }



"/add?agentType=s"

Adds 1 agent of the type specified by the string s (one of the 5 above choices, or it will return an error message).

EXAMPLE OUTPUTS:

{ response: "added 1 agent of type farmer" }

{ response: "there is no agent template for type toymaker" }



"/iterate?turns=n"

Iterates the market by n "turns."

EXAMPLE OUTPUT:

{ response: "iterated 5 turns" }
